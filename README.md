# Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm
## Introduction
Floyd Warshall Algorithm, aka 'shortest path algorithm', is used to caculated the shortest path between two vertices on a graph. This project shows a simple Floyd's algorithm to generate a solution matrix.
## Building the algorithm
In this project, the Floyd Warshall Algorithm is written in a recusive way.
## Testing
1. unit test - unittest
2. performance tests - timeit & cProfile
## Controbution
Pull requests are welcome. 
For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
